4.0.0	14-04-2010

	* add the autotools buildsystem and remove all other systems.
	* add a GUI ghkl for testing purpose based on gtkmm.
	* add the GNU info doc
	* add the gtk-doc to document the api (work in progress)
	* new structure for the HklDetector (prepare for 2D detectors)
	* HklGeometryConfig shared between all equivalent HklGeometries.
	* fix for 64 bits computers runtime error.
	* add the HklError class to report calculation errors (not yet used)
	* new way to set the UB matrix of a sample (hkl_sample_set_UB).
	* new ZAxis geometry
		- mode zaxis
		- mode reflectivity (mu = gamma)

3.0.1	23-10-2009

	* add the psi_constant mode to the e4cv, e6c, k4cv and k6c geometries. (thanks teresa)
	* upgrade the user guide to explain how to add a mode.
	* the horizontal modes are also valid if omega = +-PI. (e6c, k6c)
	* remove geometries with an invalid range from the list of solutions.

3.0.0	15-07-2009

	* Rewrote from scratch in C with the GSL library.
		- now most of pseudo axes modes are numeric.
		  So a 6 circles mode is now a real 6 circles mode.

2.3.0   24-01-2007

    * Refactoring of the sample part.
