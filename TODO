Roadmap
-------

4.0.0
	* HklPseudoAxisEngine "q" -> "qper" and "qpar"
	* HklAxis degenerated.
		an axis is degenerated if its position have no effect
		on the HklPseudoAxis calculus.
	* HklAxis method to use min/max to check for the validity
	* HklGeometryList different method to help select a solution.
		this select solution can depend on the geometry
		for example the kappa axis must be in one side of the plane.
	* add a fit on the Hklaxis offsets.
	* API to put a detector and a sample on the Geometry.
	* HklSample add the cell volum computation.
	* HklPseudoAxisEngine "zone"
	* HklPseudoAxisEngine "custom"
		for now this pseudoaxis let you select the axis you
		want to use for the computation.
	* create a macro to help compare two real the right way
	  	 fabs(a-b) < epsilon * max(1, abs(a), abs(b))
	* ghkl change the color of fitparameter cells if they differ from the current
	  sample values
	* add an hkl_sample_set_lattice_unit()
	* use the liboil to speed calculation (in HklVector, HklMatrix and HklQuaternion)
	* add a .spec file for rpm generation
